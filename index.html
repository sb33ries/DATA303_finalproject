<b><center style="font-size: 24px;margin-bottom:50px">Causes of Death and Life Expectancy Summary</center></b>
<div class="text-content"id="section1"><b>Introduction</b></div>
<div class="text-content">
    <p>Understanding mortality rates and causes of death has been an ongoing topic of research. They provide valuable information about the health of a population, potential health risks, and concerning trends. By analyzing mortality data, the public health systems and the government can provide resources and strategies to combat leading causes of death, such as increasing accessibility to blood pressure medication to reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, studying trends in mortality rates across demographics can reveal health disparities. By identifying these inequalities, healthcare authorities and policymakers can provide targeted resources to groups in need for a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources.</p>
    <p>We chose to understand trends in mortality rates because of our group’s interdisciplinary interests in biochemistry, medicine, and data science. Through this project, we hope to provide additional insights into mortality trends over time, geographic space, and between causes of death. Understanding these risks will potentially help others adopt healthier lifestyles and make more informed decisions. We also hope to apply concepts and develop skills we learn in class, as well as collaboratively find an answer to the set of open questions listed below in our Questions section. </p>
    <p>For our final project, we will analyze the leading causes of death, life expectancy, and population worldwide. These causes include those related to diseases, violence, mental health, and environmental factors. The data we will be using are publicly available from Our World in Data. The annual number of deaths by cause csv file can be found at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death">https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death</a>, the life expectancy csv file can be found at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy</a>, and the population and demography data can be found at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography">https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography.</a> </p>
</div>
<div class="text-content"id="section2"><b>Questions</b></div>
<div class="text-content">
    <ul>
        <li>How do the leading causes of death change in terms of different regions around the world?</li>
        <li>How have the causes of death changed over time in specific regions as societies, population, technology, and the environment evolved?</li>
        <li>Are specific causes of death related/dependent/connected to one another?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between life expectancy and prevailing causes of mortality (i.e., are certain causes of death more fatal)?</li>
      </ul>
</div>
<div class="text-content"id="section3"><b>Data Summary</b></div>
<div class="text-content">
    <p>We will be using a diverse set of Python libraries in order to complete our analysis, this includes but is not limited to: NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annual number of deaths data consists of 35 columns:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Code:</strong> Three-letter abbreviation for each country</li>
        <li><strong>Year:</strong> Data for each country is reported annually from 1990 to 2019</li>
        <li><strong>Deaths of various causes:</strong> The dataset includes information on various causes of death such as meningitis, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, nutritional deficiencies, malaria, drowning, interpersonal violence, maternal disorders, HIV/AIDS, drug use disorders, tuberculosis, cardiovascular diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders, alcohol use disorders, self-harm, exposure to forces of nature, diarrheal diseases, environmental heat and cold exposure, neoplasms, conflict and terrorism, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, poisonings, protein-energy malnutrition, road injuries, chronic respiratory diseases, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, digestive diseases, fire, heat, and hot substances, acute hepatitis, and measles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The life expectancy data consists of four columns: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entity:</strong> Country or region</li>
        <li><strong>Code:</strong> Three-letter abbreviation for each country</li>
        <li><strong>Year:</strong> Data for each country is reported annually from 1950 to 2017</li>
        <li><strong>Life expectancy:</strong> Period life expectancy at birth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The population and demography data consists of 40 columns, but we only used the first three:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Country Name:</strong> Country or region</li>
      <li><strong>Year:</strong> Data for each country is reported annually from 1950 to 2021</li>
      <li><strong>Population:</strong> Number of people living the country or region</li>
  </ul>
    <p>For our project, missing data presents a great threat to the credibility of our analyses of mortality rates and life expectancy findings. Data for certain years, countries, and causes, if left blank, can disrupt trends and result in misinterpretations. Reasons contributing to missing data can also be diverse, ranging from data collection errors to zero reporting or complete lack of records for certain periods or regions. Additionally, inconsistencies in data precision, such as a variation in significant figures, can further complicate the analysis. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Missing Years:</strong> A lack of data on the death toll in certain years can result in breaks in trends and hinder our ability to analyze long-term changes in mortality and longevity. For instance, if there are missing years within the dataset, it may be challenging to accurately assess the progression of health outcomes over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing countries:</strong> Incomplete data on specific countries with larger populations or unique mortality patterns could introduce potential biases in our analyses.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing causes of death:</strong> Certain causes of death being unrecorded can throw off our understanding of mortality rates. For instance, if data about new diseases or health issues are missing, it will be difficult for us to grasp their full impact on the death rate overall.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p>
    Beginning with Neonatal disorders, the primary cause of death in the African region in 2019, we note the most significant prevalence in Egypt, where these disorders accounted for 199k cases. Nigeria follows closely with 139k cases, then Morocco with 85k cases of neonatal conditions. Lower respiratory infections and Diarrheal diseases also highlights Nigeria, but includes Ethiopia and The Republic of the Congo as the three countries with the highest prevalence, albeit with varying numbers. This correlation is not incidental, likely stemming from the interplay of these diseases as comorbidities. For example, individuals afflicted with neonatal disorders at birth are more susceptible to developing lower respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases later in life. However, this pattern does not extend to HIV/AIDS and Cardiovascular disease, which exhibit a distinct distribution of prevalence across the African countries. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of HIV/AIDS, the primary cause of death in the African region in 2000, Nigeria demonstrated the highest prevalence with 248k cases, followed again by Ethiopia and The Republic of the Congo with 83.8k and 57.1k cases, respectively. Conversely, Cardiovascular disease highlights South Africa as its highest overall prevalence among all the mentioned diseases, with 162k cases, then Kenya with 86.1k cases. It is worth noting that Heart disease has maintained its status as the leading cause of death globally since 2019 (GBD 2021), which explains the high prevalence of Cardiovascular disease throughout the African region in the visualization.

  </p>
  <p>
    A correlation matrix was created to analyze correlation between different variables in our data. Due to the large size of our dataset, we only considered natural causes of deaths and omitted data that were due to unnatural causes (e.g. poisonings or drownings), disorders, and malnutrition. 
From our correlation matrix, it is evident that many of our variables are correlated by having correlation coefficients close to 1.00. This is expected because natural causes of death tend to have shared underlying conditions. For example, individuals with diabetes mellitus are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic kidney diseases. Additionally, shared risk factors can increase the risk of multiple causes of death at once. For example, smoking increases risk for both respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

<div class="text-content">
  <p>
    Looking at the correlation matrix between each cause of death and life expectancy, we noticed that neonatal disorders had the strongest correlation to life expectancy, with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of -0.866099. This suggests a strong negative relationship between neonatal disorders and life expectancy. Neonatal disorders are symptoms that deviate from the normal state of body, organs and abnormal function of a newborn.

  </p>
  <p>
    By comparing the number of deaths caused by neonatal disorders and life expectancy over time, we observe a pattern in overall increased life expectancy and decreased number of deaths caused by neonatal disorders. Additionally, the strong negative relationship between the number of deaths caused by neonatal disorders and life expectancy is observed across all years from 1990 to 2019. Considering that neonatal disorders affect infants, a lower life expectancy could be expected in those with a neonatal disorder. Two data points that appear to be outliers are Rwanda in 1994 and South Sudan in 1998. In both of these data points, the number of neonatal disorder deaths is lower than would be predicted for countries with such a life expectancy. Regarding Rwanda, this can likely be attributed to the Rwandan genocide in 1994 (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2016). This observation in South Sudan can likely be attributed to a famine in 1998 caused by civil war and human rights abuses (Human Rights Watch, 2014).

  </p>
  <p>
    A further look into the number of deaths caused by neonatal disorders across countries classified by income level shows that there is a negative correlation between number of neonatal disorder deaths and income level. Country classification by income level is evaluated by the World Bank and is determined by the gross national income (in USD) of the previous year. Higher income. Individual country classifications for each year from 1990 to 2019 can be found at <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html">World Bank Income and Region Data</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The highest positive correlation between each cause of death and life expectancy was for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of 0.642415. Dementia describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory, reasoning or other thinking skills, and Alzheimer’s disease, a degenerative brain disease caused by complex brain changes following cell damage, is the most common cause of dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019).

  </p>
  <p>
    An overall increase in life expectancy across countries over time is also associated with an increase in the number of deaths caused by Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. A country that had consistently high rates of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias relative to other countries in the world was Japan. Japan also has a relatively high life expectancy, as expected, but appears to be an outlier as the number of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia deaths increases rapidly compared to the rate of increasing life expectancy. Since the exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease and a cure are currently unknown, understanding the populations that are affected most by this disease may help in furthering research on the disease.

  </p>
  <p>
    There is also a positive correlation between the number of deaths caused by Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias and country classification by income level. This suggests that life expectancy is positively associated with country income level. Because aging is the most common risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, this positive association makes sense, and it may be beneficial to study Alzheimer’s among younger people in countries with lower income levels and lower life expectancies to gain more insight about early onset of the disease.
