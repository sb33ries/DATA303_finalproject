<div class="text-content">
    <p>For our midterm project, we will analyze the leading causes of death and life expectancy worldwide. These causes include those related to diseases, violence, mental health, and environmental factors. The data we will be using are publicly available from Our World in Data. The annual number of deaths by cause csv file can be found at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death">https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death</a> and the life expectancy csv file can be found at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy</a>. </p>
    <p>Understanding mortality rates and causes of death has been an ongoing topic of research. They provide valuable information about the health of a population, potential health risks, and concerning trends. By analyzing mortality data, the public health systems and the government can provide resources and strategies to combat leading causes of death, such as increasing accessibility to blood pressure medication to reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, studying trends in mortality rates across demographics can reveal health disparities. By identifying these inequalities, healthcare authorities and policymakers can provide targeted resources to groups in need for a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources.</p>
    <p>We chose to understand trends in mortality rates because of our groupâ€™s interdisciplinary interests in biochemistry, medicine, and data science. Through this project, we hope to provide additional insights into mortality trends over time, geographic space, and between causes of death. Understanding these risks will potentially help others adopt healthier lifestyles and make more informed decisions. We also hope to apply concepts and develop skills we learn in class, as well as collaboratively find an answer to the set of open questions listed below in our Goals section. </p>
